# multi-label-feature-selection
we complete some feature selection algorithms for multi-label learning, including:

MDFS: Manifold regularized discriminative feature selection for multi-label learning

MIFS: Multi-Label Informed Feature Selection

MSSL: Multiâ€‘label feature selection via feature manifold learningand sparsity regularization

RFS:Efficient and Robust Feature Selection via Joint $\ell_{2,1}$-Norms Minimization
