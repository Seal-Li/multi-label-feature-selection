# multi-label-feature-selection
## we complete some feature selection algorithms for multi-label learning, including:

MDFS: Manifold regularized discriminative feature selection for multi-label learning

MIFS: Multi-Label Informed Feature Selection

MSSL: Multiâ€‘label feature selection via feature manifold learningand sparsity regularization

RFS:Efficient and Robust Feature Selection via Joint $\ell_{2,1}$-Norms Minimization


## Besides, evaluations and some affinity methods were complete in this project also, like

### evaluation metrics:

Hamming Loss

Ranking Loss

One Error

Coverage

Average Precision

and so on

### affinity metrics

Cosine

Jaccard

Heat Kernel

Boolean
